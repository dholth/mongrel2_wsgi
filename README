mongrel2_wsgi
-------------

A Mongrel2 handler for WSGI applications based on Paste's copy of the
CherryPy WSGI server and eventlet.

This is a very early version, just to see what I could hack together to
see whether Mongrel2 is interesting after all.

On my machine, siege -b reports approximately 1800 transactions/second
from the test application.
